# Dotfiles by Danilosh45 ✨

Welcome to my dotfiles! This repository contains all my custom configurations for the tools and environments I use daily. I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to efficiently manage my configurations and keep them synchronized across devices.

## 🖂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized to reflect the directory structure in `$HOME` and contains configurations for various tools. Here's an overview:

```
dotfiles/
├── fish/                # Configuration for the Fish shell
├── i3/                  # Configuration for i3 Window Manager
├── i3status/            # Configuration for i3status
├── kitty/               # Configuration for the Kitty terminal
├── nvim/                # Configuration for Neovim
└── ...                  # Other configuration directories
```

## 🚀 Installation

Follow these steps to install and use my dotfiles:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository into your `$HOME` directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:danilosh45/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

### 2. Install GNU Stow
If you don't have Stow installed, you can easily do so:

- **Debian/Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install stow
  ```
- **Arch Linux**:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S stow
  ```
- **Fedora**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install stow
  ```

### 3. Link Configurations
Navigate to the repository directory and use Stow to create symbolic links for the configurations:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
stow nvim
stow i3
stow kitty
stow fish
```

Each command creates the corresponding symbolic links in the appropriate directories, such as `~/.config/nvim`, `~/.config/i3`, etc.

### 4. Customize if Necessary
If you need to make machine-specific adjustments, you can edit the files directly. Don't forget to commit your changes if you want to keep them synchronized later!
